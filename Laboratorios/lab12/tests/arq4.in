Free as in freedom
------------------

The term "free software" is sometimes misunderstood--it has nothing to
do with price. It is about freedom. Here, therefore, is the definition
of free software: a program is free software, for you, a particular
user, if:

    * You have the freedom to run the program, for any purpose.
    * You have the freedom to modify the program to suit your needs. (To
      make this freedom effective in practice, you must have access to
      the source code, since making changes in a program without having
      the source code is exceedingly difficult.)
    * You have the freedom to redistribute copies, either gratis or for
      a fee.
    * You have the freedom to distribute modified versions of the
program, so that the community can benefit from your improvements.

Since "free" refers to freedom, not to price, there is no contradiction
between selling copies and free software. In fact, the freedom to sell
copies is crucial: collections of free software sold on CD-ROMs are
important for the community, and selling them is an important way to
raise funds for free software development. Therefore, a program which
people are not free to include on these collections is not free software.
